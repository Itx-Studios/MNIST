**ITX Numscan is a MNIST-Classificator for classifying handwritten digits**

This Repository contains 3 different main programs:

1. Numscan (Classifying digits with deep-learning networks, more technical and vanilla)

2. Numscan 2 (Classifying digits with Convolutional neural networks, faster and with tensorflow)

3. Discord-Bot (Discord Bot Application, which uses Numscan 1 or 2)
